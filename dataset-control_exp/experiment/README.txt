-- Dataset Control: Letters and Colors administer experiment to participants --

PsychoPy tasks to be run in a python environment (we used PsychoPy version 1.82).

First, activate the python environment before running any tasks.
Second, make sure the EyeLink is on. 

Control_IRF.py is a control experiment measuring the pupil dilation in response to the colors presented during the decision task.
This script runs with the EyeLink. Do a calibration and validation before the task starts.

Control_Feedback.py is a control experiment measuring the pupil dilation in response to the auditory feedback (tones) during the decision task.
This script runs with the EyeLink. Do a calibration and validation before the task starts.



-- Instructions (general): --

Finally, the 3rd task is to measure your pupil’s response to colors or sounds. Look at the fixation cross at all times and don’t move your eyes around during this part of the experiment. If you see a colored square, press the right button as fast as possible.



-- Instructions calibration/validation of eye-tracker: --


You will see a small dot appear on the screen. You are to follow the dot with your eyes, so we can ‘tell’ the eye-tracker where you are looking. 

However, do not try to anticipate where the dot will move by searching around the screen for it. Keep fixating on the dot, then only after the dot moves, follow the dot with your eyes. 

Again, keep your fixation/gaze on the dot until it has moved to a new position. 

This calibration procedure will take place 2 or more times.
